## Reasoning
I selected this project based on my passion for reading, as it is one of my favorite pastimes. Having experienced the challenge of discovering a captivating book, I was motivated to leverage my data analysis skills to assist others in finding their next page-turner. Moreover, I recognized an opportunity to demonstrate my proficiency in Power BI, a visualization tool that has rapidly become my personal favorite. By tackling this project, I aimed to tackle a real-world problem while simultaneously showcasing my expertise in this visualization tool.

## The Data
The dataset was retrieved from a user on Kaggle who scraped the data entirely from the Goodreads API - [Link to Original Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks)

The dataset itself contains information on over 11,000 unique publications available through Good Reads. These publications include everything from single page press releases to full-fledged novels dating back to the early 1900s. 

Some examples of the columns present in the data include the following:

- bookID
- title
- authors
- average_rating
- isbn
- language_code
- ratings_count
- publication_date
- publisher

## Data Cleaning
I began the data cleaning process by considering the data and planning a rough draft of my final vizualition. Once I had a rough idea of what information would most benefit my stakeholders reading decision given the avaiable data. I downloaded a copy of the data in .csv format and subsequently loaded it directly into Microsoft Power BI for transformation. 

You can find a copy of the .csv file [HERE].
