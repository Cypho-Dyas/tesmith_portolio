# DATA ANALYST PORTFOLIO

## ABOUT ME

Hi there!

My name is Travis Smith and I am currently enrolled in the BSBA - (Management) program at Appalachian State University's Walker College of Business. I plan on graduating from the program this May (2023).

During my time at the college, I have been influenced by several courses in topics such as Business Analytics using Spreadsheet Technology, Statistics, Strategic Management, and Commercial Finance. It was these influences that eventually led me to pursue a career in data analytics/data science after graduation. As part of that goal, I have decided to learn as many of the data science tools and software as I can prior to graduation and before I begin my job search in earnest.

Most of my experience prior to returning to school is in the Biotech/Clinical Research industries, where I spent more than 5 years in various management and administrative roles working for both a contract sterile-injectable manufacturer and a global CRO. 

I have created this portfolio to house projects that I complete as I learn the data analysis tools/software that will be needed for my future career and I sincerely hope you enjoy viewing them as much as I have enjoyed working on them. You can navigate the portfolio by clicking on the folders in the repository shown above this README file. Each project will have its own folder and README file describing my reasoning, methodology, insights, recommendations, and things I would improve for future projects.
