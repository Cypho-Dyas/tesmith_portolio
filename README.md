# DATA ANALYST PORTFOLIO

## ABOUT ME

Hello,

I'm Travis Smith, a recent graduate of Appalachian State University's Walker College of Business, where I earned my B.S. in Business Administration with a concentration in Business Management. Throughout my time at the college, I was exposed to courses in business analytics, statistics, strategic management, and commercial finance, which sparked my passion for data analytics and led me to pursue a career in the field.

Prior to returning to school in 2020 to earn my undergraduate degree, I gained over 5 years of experience in management and administrative roles within the pharmaceutical manfuacturing and clinical research industries. During this time I worked for a contract manfuacturer of sterile-injectable pharmaceuticals as well as a multinational clinical research organization.

In my pursuit of a data analytics/data science career, I have developed this portfolio to showcase my personal projects as I acquire proficiency in various data science tools and software. 

I'm eager to contribute my skills and expertise to a relevant position in the field, and I hope you find my portfolio compelling and enjoyable.

Thank you for your consideration.
