# DATA ANALYST PORTFOLIO

## ABOUT ME

Hello,

I'm Travis Smith, a recent graduate of Appalachian State University's Walker College of Business, where I completed the BSBA - Management program. Throughout my time at the college, I was exposed to courses in Business Analytics, Statistics, Strategic Management, and Commercial Finance, which sparked my passion for data analytics and led me to pursue a career in the field.

Prior to returning to school at the age of 29, I gained over 5 years of experience in management and administrative roles within the Biotech/Clinical Research industries. During this time I worked for a contract sterile-injectable manufacturer and a global clinical research organization.

In my pursuit of a data analytics/data science career, I have developed this portfolio to showcase my projects as I acquire proficiency in various data science tools and software. I'm eager to contribute my skills and expertise to a relevant position in the field, and I hope you find my portfolio compelling and enjoyable.

Thank you for your consideration.
