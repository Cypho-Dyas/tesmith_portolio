## Reasoning
I chose this dataset to gain insights into the world of data professionals both internationally and domestically. This is crucial for me as I'm currently job hunting in this field and want to be prepared for what lies ahead. Additionally, I aim to enhance my skills and understand which ones are valuable for my job search. This project will serve as a great opportunity to showcase my Power BI expertise and fulfill my goal of having two projects each for Power BI and Tableau in my portfolio.

## The Data

This dataset was obtained from Alex Freburg's [GitHub page](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/Power-BI/blob/main/Power%20BI%20-%20Final%20Project.xlsx), resulting from an international survey conducted by Alex himself. It includes responses from hundreds of global data professionals to simple data-related questions.

The raw data is in a Microsoft Excel .xlxs file. Instead of manually cleaning it in Excel, I imported the file directly into Power BI and used Power Query for cleaning.

The data file has columns representing survey questions and observations representing unique survey respondents and their answers.

A non-exaushstive list of the fields present in the data file are shown below for reference:
