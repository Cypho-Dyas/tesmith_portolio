# Data Professional Survey Results Analysis

## Skills Displayed

- Data Cleaning (Power Query) & Analysis

## Reasoning
I chose this dataset to gain insights into the world of data professionals both internationally and domestically. This is crucial for me as I'm currently job hunting in this field and want to be prepared for what lies ahead. Additionally, I aim to enhance my skills and understand which ones are valuable for my job search. This project will serve as a great opportunity to showcase my Power BI expertise and fulfill my goal of having two projects each for Power BI and Tableau in my portfolio.

## The Data
This dataset was actually obtained from Alex Freburg's github page located [HERE](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/Power-BI/blob/main/Power%20BI%20-%20Final%20Project.xlsx). The dataset is avaialbe as part of Alex's data analyst tutorial program which was very handy when I was first starting out my learning journey. I remember coming across this data set inititally and thinking that it would be a great thing to do a porject on for myself when I was still working through school, but at the time I had not yet begun this portfolio so I saved a link for later use.
